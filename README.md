# Connected Wise - AutoConnect

Connected Wise<sup>SM</sup> focuses on research and development to support the deployment of connected automated vehicles, while advancing automated driving technology safety, security, data, and artificial intelligence. 

AutoConnect is a platform environment built ontop of USDOT's extensible platform CARMA for controlling SAE level 2 connected automated vehicles (CAVs). It provides a demonstration and testing interface along with the backend infrastructure.

Connected automated vehicle (CAV) technology has important implications in terms of transportation system management and operations. Yet, it also raises concerns over non-automated road users, particularly in rural areas, where the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure necessary for the deployment of CAV technology is lacking. On the other hand, building such infrastructure (e.g. roadside equipment - RSE) in rural areas at the desired standards is a challenging task and requires substantial investment, which limits the availability of CAV technology to urban areas. Therefore, it is unclear how CAVs will safely and securely navigate when travelling outside of ICT infrastructure (e.g. in rural areas) encountering unsignalized intersections, lane closures, abrupt road geometry changes, or work-zone detours.

AutoConnect is able to recognize unique visual identifiers on the smart traffic signs designed by Connected Wise to activate the Infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) messages to assist CAVs when they are travelling outside the range of Intelligent Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure with important roadway information such as operational messages, basic safety messages, and roadway geometry data.

## Who is Connected Wise ?

Connected Wise is a transportation research and development company founded by several Ph.D. graduates specializing in Connected Automated Vehicle technology, vehicular communication, and transportation safety. The company is known for its unique technological solution to support vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication using smart traffic signs. The technology eliminates the need for wireless infrastructure especially in areas, where wireless communication is not practical, such as rural and underserved areas. Connected Wiseâ€™s technological solution has been previously awarded USDOT SBIR Phase I and Phase II grants. The company has been closely collaborating with federal agencies (i.e. USDOT FHWA and USDOT CARMA), State DOTs, and public administrations during the R&D efforts of this technology.
